    <h2> Engagement Chicken</h2>

    <p>Here it is: the recipe that started it all. And once you've made it, you'll know why. It serves up the kind of home-cooked goodness that no restaurant meal can top. The chicken's crispy skin is drenched in herb-infused juices (don't forget to pour the pan dripping back over the chicken before serving or, alternately, to drizzle them over individual pieces on the plate), and the trick of turning the chicken 15 minutes into cooking keeps the meat uniquely moist.</p>

    <p>Any simple sides will work with a main course this splendid. You can go with either white wine (in which case a Riesling would be nice) or red (try pinot noir). Happy cooking-and an even happier future to you and the lucky person you've deemed worthy of this dish.</p>

    <h2>The $250 Cookie Recipe</h2>
    <h3> Posted 10/01/2006</h3>
    <img class="cookieimg" img src="cookie.png">
    <p>Almost everybody has heard the one about the woman lunching at the Neiman Marcus Cafe in Dallas, who enjoyed the chocolate chip cookies so much that she asked for the recipe. For "only two-fifty," the waitress said, it was hers. But when the credit card bill arrived, the woman found the total near $300. Turns out the recipe cost $250, the story goes. In 1997, after years of enduring the myth, Neiman Marcus came up with a recipe – and gave it out for free. It's a delicious variation on chocolate chip cookies, using ground oatmeal, nuts and adding extra chocolate with a grated Hershey bar (you can use any brand you love).
    <p> INGREDIENTS
  <li>1 cup butter
  <li>1 cup dark brown sugar, packed
  <li>1 cup granulated sugar
  <li>2 eggs
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla
  <li>2 ½ cups oatmeal
  <li>2 cups flour
  <li>½ teaspoon salt
  <li>1 teaspoon baking soda
  <li>1 teaspoon baking powder
  <li>12 ounces chocolate chips
  <li>1 4-ounce milk chocolate bar
  <li>1 ½ cups chopped nuts </p>

<p>Heat oven to 375 degrees.
<p>Cream together butter and both sugars. Stir in eggs and vanilla.
Finely grind oatmeal in a blender or food processor. Combine the oatmeal, flour, salt, baking powder and soda in a medium bowl, and slowly add it to the wet ingredients. Beat just until combined. Grate chocolate bar using a microplane grater and add it, along with chocolate chips and nuts to the batter. Mix just to combine.
Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls, 2 inches apart, on a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes.
